## 📝 Description

**The Library System (LS)** is a Python application designed to be fast and user-friendly. Featuring a modern dark mode interface, it was engineered to ensure a fluid experience without lags or unnecessary wait times.
In this new version, the system evolves from a simple search tool into a comprehensive solution. It is built upon three core concepts: **Binary Search Trees (BST)**, which organize book codes for agile record retrieval; **Inverted Indexes**, which help locate keywords without scanning the entire database; and **Fuzzy Search**, which understands user intent even with typos or incomplete names.
Ultimately, the system handles large volumes of books without losing performance, maintaining a balance between technical efficiency and a simple, pleasant daily user experience.

## 💡 Technical Highlights

The main feature of this update is the Advanced Search Module, which employs different strategies based on user input:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Implemented from scratch for exact numerical searches and range queries;
- **Inverted Index:** A technique used by major search engines like Google to find keywords in titles and authors instantaneously, without traversing the entire list;
- **Fuzzy Search (Levenshtein):** A string similarity algorithm that finds results even if the user misspells the book title.

## 🎯 Features

- **Collection Management:** Detailed book registration including title, author, genre, and stock with automatic indexing for instant searches;
- **Student Records:** Centralized user control, storing IDs and contact data securely;
- **Dynamic Editing:** Allows updating information for books and students already in the system, keeping the database current;
- **Loan Management:** Agile checkout process, linking students to books and documenting withdrawal dates;
- **Returns Management:** Automatic processing of returns with immediate updates to collection availability;
- **Queries and Reports:** Organized visualization of all registered data, facilitating audits of students, books, and transactions.

## 💻 Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

**1. Python 3.10 or higher..**

**2. Dependencies:**

- PySide6;
- qdarktheme;
- rapidfuzz.

**3.Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux**

## 🚀 Running the Project

**1. Instalar o python**

Check if you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. To do this, follow these steps:

Open the Terminal (on Windows, use Command Prompt or PowerShell).

Type the following command to check the version:

```bash
python --version
```

**Or**

```bash
python3 --version
```

If you don't have Python 3.10, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**2. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project repository to your machine. Open the terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eda2-2026/G41_Busca_EDA2-2026.1.git
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the **requirements.txt** file is not present, you can install the dependencies manually:* **Install Pyside6**

```bash
pip install pyside6 
```

- **Install qdarktheme**

```bash
pip install qdarktheme
```

- **Install rapidfuzz**

```bash
pip install rapidfuzz
```

**4. Run the Program**

With the environment configured and dependencies installed, you can now run the system:

```bash
python biblioteca.py
```

**Or**

```bash
python3 biblioteca.py
```

**⚠️ Note:**
If the code presents any error during execution, verify if all necessary files are present (especially the .json files in the db_files directory).
